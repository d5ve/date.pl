=item * 2015-03-26 - VERSION 0.93

Removed old attempt at extra timezone parsing. It didn't work well.

Added support for "N (minutes|hours|days) ago".

Converted functions to methods, so they can access the object's particular
local and remote timezones.

=item * 2015-03-26 - VERSION 0.92

Convert to modulino in prep for testing.

=item * 2015-03-26 - VERSION 0.91

Handle dates of the form "26 March 2015 at 06:55" as gmail presents in replies.

Handle unix timestamps.

Attempt to parse TZ from strings before calling DataParse.

=item * 2015-02-09 - VERSION 0.9
